# SCRIPTS

Some of the scripts I use on an almost daily basis

## Usage 

- Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/kartikarora/scripts`
- Put `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/cloned/directory` at the end of your `~/.bashrc`
- Run `source ~/.bashrc` to load the new `PATH`

## Scripts

#### git_proxy.sh

Run `chmod a+x git_proxy.sh` to make it executable

#### system_proxy.sh

Run `chmod a+x system_proxy.sh` to make it executable

Requires [dconf-tools](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/dconf-tools/), works only on Ubuntu for now.

To install Dconf, run:
- `sudo apt-get install dconf-tools` 
- `sudo apt install dconf-tools` (16.04 and above)


## Contribution

Improvements, suggestions and new scripts are always welcome. Fork, push, submit a Pull Request.
